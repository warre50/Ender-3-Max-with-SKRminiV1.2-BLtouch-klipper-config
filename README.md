# Ender-3-Max-with-SKRminiV1.2-BLtouch-klipper-config
This is my configuration for klipper I made for a friend his Ender 3 Max with an SKRmini E3 V1.2 motherboard with BLtouch


The offset for the BLtouch probe are not yet correct and need to be set to your specific setup

use this as example:
-
-     +-- BACK ---+
-      |           |
-    L |    (+) P  | R <-- probe (20,20)
-    E |           | I
-    F | (-) N (+) | G <-- nozzle (10,10)
-    T |           | H
-      |    (-)    | T
-      |           |
-      O-- FRONT --+
-   (0,0)
